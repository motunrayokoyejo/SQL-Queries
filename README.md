# SQL-Queries

I worked  with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. I wrote SQL Queries to retrieve the interesting data.

The following are the questions my queries answered.

i. What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

ii. What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

iii.What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

iv.How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

v. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
